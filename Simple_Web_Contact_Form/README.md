# Simple Web Contact Form

## Usage & installation ðŸ¤–

Install express through npm

```
npm init -y
npm install express
```

Start server with:
`node index.js`
And then you can find the website by typing `localhost:3000/` into any browser

## What is this ðŸ¤¨

This simple project is a design prompt from [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/create-a-contact-form-b2n9ltrdy1) where the user can input:

- Name
- E-mail
- Dropdown with issues
- Text area for comments

The data is then sent to the server and back to be displayed in a new page. Instead of using PHP to parse the form data I wanted to experiment and learn more about the Express.js library which is used together with NodeJS server.
